📄 Likitha Website Development Brief

Hand-Painted Wearable Art + Fine Art Portfolio
Minimal Luxury Website – Inspired by Ofelia Botella

1. Project Overview

This website showcases Likitha’s dual creative practice:

Hand-painted wearable art — jackets, shirts, bags, accessories, shoes.

Canvas artworks — textured contemporary pieces with cultural influences.

The site must present both identities in a balanced, minimalistic, luxury design, with clean editorial layouts, soft neutral colors, and generous whitespace.

Target tone:
Minimal luxury · Calm · Gallery-inspired · Editorial · High-end craftsmanship

The developer must use the Ofelia Botella website as a visual + structural reference for spacing, typography, layout rhythm, and minimal aesthetics.

2. Core Goals

Present wearable art and fine art equally on the homepage.

Provide clear navigation to:

Wearable Art Collection

Canvas Art Gallery

Custom Orders

Collaborations / Events

Maintain a premium, minimal, artistic brand identity.

Use clean layouts, neutral colors, and elegant typography similar to the reference site.

Ensure imagery is the hero — large, uncluttered, and editorial.

3. Global Design Guidelines
Typography

Use fonts similar to:

Serif (Headings): Playfair Display / Editorial New / similar refined serif

Sans-serif (Body): Inter / Helvetica Neue / GT America

Thin letter-spacing, soft weight, calm tone.

Headings should be large but minimal.

Color Palette

Off-white (#F5F3EE)

Linen / beige neutrals (#EDE9E4)

Charcoal (#333333)

Warm soft gold (#CBAE7E) used minimally (optional)

Layout Style

Wide margins and whitespace

Centralized content blocks

Soft shadows or no shadows

Clean grid alignment

Subtle transitions (fade-in, crossfades)

Photography Style

Editorial feel

Neutral backgrounds

Soft natural lighting

Calm, uncluttered compositions
